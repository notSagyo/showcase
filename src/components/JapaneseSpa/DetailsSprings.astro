      <b>Hot springs</b>, also known as onsen in Japan, are natural geothermal pools that contain
      warm, mineral-rich water. They are believed to offer a range of health benefits, including
      relaxation, improved circulation and relief from aches and pains.
    </p>
    <p class='max-w-xs'>
      You can soak in the hot springs, either indoor or outdoor, and experience their relaxing and
      rejuvenating effects.
